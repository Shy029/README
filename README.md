Medical Assistant - AI-powered Symptom Diagnosis
This project provides a basic medical assistant that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help diagnose symptoms based on user input.
# FEATURES
* Takes user input for symptoms (comma-separated).
* Analyzes symptoms based on a knowledge base or machine learning model (depending on your implementation).
* Recommends potential diagnoses.
# USAGE
* Enter your symptoms separated by commas (e.g., fever, cough).
* The program will analyze the symptoms and suggest potential diagnoses.

# Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS)
Backend: Python (Spark for model processing)
Machine Learning Model: Collaborative Filtering (ALS)
for backend we are using flask and ngrok
# How to use
authentication token of ngrok
(only run once, don't run twice)
if error occurs
if end points crosses 
//reset token
then authentication token will be changed.
use new one
//upload static folder
//upload the templete folder
//upload the datasets
we are using the colab notebook for running the code.
simply download the files.
upload it in the colab .upload foladers also.then make a account on ngrok copy paste the authtoken 
# create a templates folder and store index.html there
# create a static folde rand export data of zip file there
